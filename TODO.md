THE B-UGS
<!-- for the life of me i couldn't fix this im sorry -->
- The thing where after a while you can't close windows with the X button
	* Also all the hovers in buttons become trigereable when hovering the folder obj
	* Might be related to their respective components meaning they suck hard ass
	* IT'S DEFINETELY RELATED TO POWERUPS and when you click a lot of them at once (the components still suck hard ass fix if possible)

- Clicking the folder object many times causes it to run away (for  some reason)
- Areas will stutter when hovering over 2 at the same time?? (has to do with scale probably)
	* Store window button and window probably
- Figure out a way to make it so scale doesn't affect area
