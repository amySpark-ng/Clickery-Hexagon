## RUNNING
1. `pnpm i` - Installs all the dependencies
2. `pnpm dev` - Starts hosting the game locally in localhost:8000
3. You have to make a `env.json` file in `src`, holding this:
```json
{
	"API_ID": "",
	"ENCRIPTION_KEY": "",
	"LEADERBOARD_ID": 0
}
```
- The newgrounds code should not work if no keys are present, but this is so imports don't nag you
4. Edit the files to work on it :thumbsup:
