* Do "-" for issues, "*" for notes, "^" for comments on either

# Issues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
## General
- Make minibuttons wave at the speed of the song? would be funny hehehe
- Format actual working numbers
- Loading screen isn't working
- Do general unlocking stuff, like when you first start the game, also the start transition, so cool stuff
- Make pinch animation
- Rework tooltips

- REWRITING THE MOUSE SYSTEM IN PROGRESS:
* Unactive windows have some undesired behaviour (not unhovering hexagon)
* Buttons inside windows don't have hovers
## Windows
- If hasn't unlocked folderObj i think GameState.unlockedWindows should be null
- You can click hexagon while hovering window for drag, then you drag it and it will not play clickRelease
* For clicking behind object should check if any other window that is not the current one is active, if any other window is active the button should not work

### Store
* Store elements don't go darker with the unactive color because their color is being defined by score amount and price
- Ending hover doesn't restore the holding to buy time
### Music
* Change vynil to cd, looks better
- play bar stutters when going back
- fix music waving speed
### Color
* Sliders are not precise, too lazy to fix it probably
### Settings
- Volume not synced with volume bar

# Ideas
- Add achievement for making the hexagon black and the bg white (bad apple)
- Do the funny thing with music title in clicker.wav like deltarune did
- Random chance of +1 making something funny
- Image if the game had support for adding your own songs
- Different messages in the mage scene
^ add a normal" translation button where the mage doesn't speak shakesperean


# Arte: 
- Boton de la carpeta (folderObj)
