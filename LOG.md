# ISSUES (hell)
## Current TODO (small stuff mostly)

<!-- ascension -->
- takes 10-15-20 mins to reach 75 million of total score, that's good
- maybe 40 millions is good too, game gets boring a little bit after 30
- there's a point where stuff is too expensive and you have to click too much to buy at least
^ that's where you got to ascend

- make powerups a little bit cheaper
- implement cards sound
- make new graphic for upgrades
- increase the prices of click upgrades and cursor upgradess
^ just a little
- make cursors more powerful so you don't have to click too much
- add the mute dialogue option 
- make it so spamming the powerup unlock store element is nicer
- what the hell happens why the fuck do achievements appear and appear and appear and appear
- unified format time function
- AudioParam.value setter value being assigned is not a finite floating point value
^ this happens in the sfxHandler.volume update line in the audiomanager
- add critical sound

- make a component that manages the hovers of objects inside and outside of a window
