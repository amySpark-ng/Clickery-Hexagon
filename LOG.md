# ISSUES (hell)
## Current TODO (small stuff mostly)

<!-- ================ -->
	IMPORTANT!!!!!!
<!-- ================ -->
- start work on newgrounds api and leaderboards -->

<!-- balancing -->
- you shouldn't be able to buy awesome powerup
- prices increase TOO MUCH after ascending (if clickers are 25 second time ascending they should be 29, or maybe instead of increasing base price increase percentageIncrease)
- make powerups cheaper

<!-- ascension -->
- takes 10-15-20 mins to reach 5 million of total score, that's good

<!-- graphics -->
- change color of upgrades
- fix hexagon scale when ascending
- add the mute dialogue option
- make the color window (rework it code and graphic)
	^ make both windows different files and make a different file for buttons and sliders
- blab powerup (you click it and it's random funny messages)

- the fucking thing where powerup logs come again and again and again
- blinking text is on the wrong position
- upgrade tutorial tooltip doesn't work
- figure out why does the game crash sometimes when coming back (probably related to kaplay CPU usage)
- do tutorial for ascending (how i don't know)
