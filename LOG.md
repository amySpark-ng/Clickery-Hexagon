# Little TODO (tomorrow)

# This got messy quick didn't it
TASKBAR SYSTEM / EXTRA WINDOW
- Extrawin should not be on taskbar

- Do checkbox animation
- Add combo bar
^ Maybe add bar above or below scoretext

- Do general unlocking stuff, like when you first start the game, also the start transition, so cool stuff
- Format actual working numbers
^ Make it work with new shorten numbers setting
- Re-design make working toasts
- Keep working on store
- Fix minibutton snap when hovering and spin animation
- Do minibutton shockwave

# Issues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
## General
- Make minibuttons wave at the speed of the song? would be funny hehehe
- Loading screen isn't working
- Make pinch animation
- Rework tooltips
- Fix panderito hitbox
- Figure out why gamescene breaks when re-entering after being on ascendscnee
- I think toasts don't work when being out of the game a lot

- REWRITING THE MOUSE SYSTEM IN PROGRESS:
* Unactive windows have some undesired behaviour (not unhovering hexagon)
* Buttons inside windows don't have hovers
* Minibuttons will play "cursor" sometims when hovering from the folderObj

## Windows
- You can click hexagon while hovering window for drag, then you drag it and it will not play clickRelease
* For clicking behind object should check if any other window that is not the current one is active, if any other window is active the button should not work

### Store
* Store elements don't go darker with the unactive color because their color is being defined by score amount and price
### Music
* Change vynil to cd, looks better
- fix music waving speed
### Color
* Sliders are not precise, too lazy to fix it probably
### Settings
- Volume not synced with volume bar

# Ideas
- Add achievement for making the hexagon black and the bg white (bad apple)
- Do the funny thing with music title in clicker.wav like deltarune did
- Random chance of +1 making something funny
- Image if the game had support for adding your own songs
- Different messages in the mage scene
- Add an achievement for opening all windows at the same time 
- Make unactive windows grayscale

# Arte: 
- Boton de la carpeta (folderObj)
