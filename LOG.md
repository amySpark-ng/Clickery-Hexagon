this game is never getting done bruh

-- MUSIC WORKS PRETTY FUCKIGN WEIRD WHEN DOING LOADMUSIC INSTEAD OF SOUND DON'T GET SCARED
	* Time text not working, music not looping, etc
* Do "-" for issues, "*" for notes, "^" for comments on either

# The day after
- Do in store what happens when the upgrade is not a value one but a frequency one
	* Add the blinking text somewhere where it says "Cursors now click every `freq` seconds"
	* And if you try to buy the one above 5 seconds the tooltip will instead say, "you have to buy the previous one"

- Format actual working numbers
	* SPS WORKING RELIES ON THIS ^
- spstext doesn't work with the spsTextMode at all lol 
	* It's completely broken
	* Make it work with new shorten numbers setting (might not do)
- Fix panderito hitbox
- I REALLYYY need to fix the hover animations
- and the mouse animations
	* Maybe do keep the tag system, just uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
- fix music waving speed

# Pasado pasado maÃ±ana
- Prototype medals window
- Prototype powerups

# Soon
- and click priortiy (holy moly)

# Issues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
## General

## Windows
* For clicking behind object should check if any other window that is not the current one is active, if any other window is active the button should not work

# Ideas
- Add achievement for making the hexagon black and the bg white (bad apple)
- Do the funny thing with music title in clicker.wav like deltarune did
- Add an achievement for opening all windows in your taskbar at the same time
- Discount powerup (very short)
- when clicking run through every achievement in an object that has a clicking property and check if the score is higher or equal to a value property, so:
```js
	onClick(() => {
		achivements.forEach((achievement) => {
			if (!achievement.clicking) return;
			if (GameState.score >= achievement.value && !gamestate.unlockedAchievements.100score) unlockAchievement(achivements.100score)
		})
	})
```
- ADD THE THING WHERE THE GNOME WALKS ACROSS THE SCREEN AND BE LIKE HOLY SHIT GUYS DID YOU SEE THAT?
	* Every second have a chance of something% that triggers it
