this game MIGHT be getting done

* Do "-" for issues, "*" for notes, "^" for comments on either

# ISSUES (hell)
## Current TODO (small stuff mostly)
- move the openWindowButton class to windowsApi folder since there won't be more classes probably
- in some addObject stuffs make them consts since the object variable itself will not be changed
- takes 10-15-20 mins to reach 75 million of total score, that's good
- there's a point where stuff is too expensive and you have to click too much to buy at least
^ that's where you got to ascend
- increase the prices of click upgrades
^ just a little
- combo is so fucking op!!!! (maybe max of 5-7 instead of 10)
<!-- niceEli -->
0-300 no combo
300-600 2x
600-700 3x
700-800 4x
800-1000 5x
>1000 HYPERDRIVE (8x)
dont say its 8x
just say HYPERDRIVE
its more cool

- BU-GS I HATE THEM -
- cursor tooltip tutorial is bugged appears when it shouldnt' powerups t oo
- complete all achievements achivment is bugged
- holding down to buy is bugged because it keeps clicking even if you don't have score for it
- i don't see the gifted powerup after 1 minute after you unllck them
- do powerups spawning even fucking work
- price doesn't increase when buying powerups
- gnome achievement is not granted
- why is achievementUnlocked getting called several times, sometimes

- yes the memory crash of powerups still happens

- make all the cards a single animation and change them using the frame (only include icons, number and price is ingame)
- add the mute dialogue option

- IDEA: make a component to manage hovers, add onHoverStart function and onHoverEnd

## Next features
- Prototype ascending mechanic (prestige/mana, what time do you get to ascend, actually add the percentages)

## Complex stuff
- and click priortiy (holy moly)
	* For clicking behind object should check if any other window that is not the current one is active, if any other window is active the button should not work

- I REALLYYY need to fix the hover animations
	* and the mouse animations
	^ Maybe do keep the tag system, just uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
	* I think i had this crazy idea that 

# IDEAS (good)
- Add achievement for making the hexagon black and the bg white (bad apple)

# Missing
- Ascend mechanic
	* Mechanics, numbers
- Newgrounds api
