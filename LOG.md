# ISSUES (hell)
## Current TODO (small stuff mostly)

<!-- ascension -->
- takes 10-15-20 mins to reach 75 million of total score, that's good
- maybe 40 millions is good too, game gets boring a little bit after 30
- there's a point where stuff is too expensive and you have to click too much to buy at least
^ that's where you got to ascend

- increase the prices of click upgrades
^ just a little
- make powerups a little bit cheaper
- add chains sound
- add cards sound
- make new graphic for upgrades
- why are prices so cheap in cursor upgrades

- fix the powerup store element so the icon it's centered
