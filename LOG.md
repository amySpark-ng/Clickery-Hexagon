this game MIGHT be getting done

* Do "-" for issues, "*" for notes, "^" for comments on either

# ISSUES (hell)
## Current TODO (small stuff mostly)
- in some addObject stuffs make them consts since the object variable itself will not be changed
- takes 10-15-20 mins to reach 75 million of total score, that's good
- maybe 40 millions is good too, game gets boring a little bit after 30
- there's a point where stuff is too expensive and you have to click too much to buy at least
^ that's where you got to ascend
- increase the prices of click upgrades
^ just a little
- make powerups a little bit cheaper
- add achievements for reaching certain amounts of clickers or cursors
- add achievements for score per second, so if your score per second is greater than etc
- add chains sound
- make new graphic

<!-- some powerup stuff -->
- make powerupRandomPos() so it's not too close to buttons or other stuff
- did the powerup percentageIncrease increase a much lot???

<!-- bugs -->
- BU-GS I HATE THEM -
- tutorial tooltip for clickers doesn't appear
- and getting the one for cursors at the wrong time
- complete all achievements achivment is bugged
- CRASH OF POWERUPS STILL EXISTS
^ might be related to the loop that blinks the dieAnim
- make all the cards a single animation and change them using the frame (only include icons, number and price is ingame)
- add the mute dialogue option

- IDEA: make a component to manage hovers, add onHoverStart function and onHoverEnd

## Next features
- Prototype ascending mechanic (prestige/mana, what time do you get to ascend, actually add the percentages)

## Complex stuff
- simpleNumberFormatting change to formatNumber but has a simple opt that returns what the simpleNumberFormatting funcion would have
- and click priortiy (holy moly)
	* For clicking behind object should check if any other window that is not the current one is active, if any other window is active the button should not work

- I REALLYYY need to fix the hover animations
	* and the mouse animations
	^ Maybe do keep the tag system, just uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
	* I think i had this crazy idea that 

# IDEAS (good)
- Add achievement for making the hexagon black and the bg white (bad apple)

# Missing
- Ascend mechanic
	* Mechanics, numbers
- Newgrounds api
