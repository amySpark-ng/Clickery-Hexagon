this game MIGHT be getting done

* Do "-" for issues, "*" for notes, "^" for comments on either

<!-- KAPLAY -->
- there might be a bug in the loop function

# ISSUES (hell)
## Current TODO (small stuff mostly)
- make the time for the time powerup be the time you "skip" getting the score for
- yes the memory crash of powerups still happens

- make all the cards a single animation and change them using the frame (only include icons, number and price is ingame)
- add the mute dialogue option

## Next features
- Prototype ascending mechanic (prestige/mana, what time do you get to ascend, actually add the percentages)

## Complex stuff
- and click priortiy (holy moly)
	* For clicking behind object should check if any other window that is not the current one is active, if any other window is active the button should not work

- I REALLYYY need to fix the hover animations
	* and the mouse animations
	^ Maybe do keep the tag system, just uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
	* I think i had this crazy idea that 

# IDEAS (good)
- Add achievement for making the hexagon black and the bg white (bad apple)

# Missing
- Ascend mechanic
	* Mechanics, numbers
- Newgrounds api
