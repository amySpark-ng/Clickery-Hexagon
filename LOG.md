# ISSUES (hell)
## Current TODO (small stuff mostly)

<!-- ================ -->
	IMPORTANT!!!!!!
<!-- ================ -->
- start work on newgrounds api and leaderboards -->

<!-- balancing -->
- increase the prices of click upgrades and cursor upgradess
^ just a little
- make cursors more powerful so you don't have to click too much
- unified format time function
- make the start ascending at 50 millions
- everything is too easy to get but at the same time it's too hard
- you shouldn't be able to buy awesome powerup

<!-- ascension -->
- takes 10-15-20 mins to reach 75 million of total score, that's good
- maybe 40 millions is good too, game gets boring a little bit after 30
- there's a point where stuff is too expensive and you have to click too much to buy at least
^ that's where you got to ascend
- balance powerups they are TOOOO FUCKING OP TOOK ME 5 MINUTES REACH 70 MILLIONS

<!-- code -->
- clicking an upgrade and then trying to hover the hexagon but it doesn't hover
	* it's only when it fucking pleases
- make exclamation have the same opacity as the obj
- why do achivements come in 2
- why do all achievements say this achievement is a secret
- fullscreen checkbox doesn't listen for fullscreen change
- update extra window minibuttons to work with insideWindowHover
	* also the stuff that uses endHover when dropping on cursor exit canvas
- what happens when minibutton releasedrop endhoverfunction what
- if you intend to hold a minibutton and then move your mouse the minibutton behaves weirdly
- minibutton behaviour for outsideHoverWindow generally works very weirdly
- probably because they're curDraggin
- make that getPosOnGrid function and make it so stuff like the timers and the buttons work with it
- check what the hell does the moveToPosition parameter in minibutton does
- move addtooltip to be children of obj, idk why it doesn't work like this but it causes problem with some other stuff in layering and z
- make the wait() timer in the toast be part of the obj so it you close it nothing weird will happen
- detuen in bought progress is not working i thikn
- why does mouse play cursor when buying sometimes 
- tooltip is re added every time you hover upgrade
- why are achievements added over and over again

<!-- graphics -->
- change color of upgrades
- you can see hexagon in ascend substate even if scale is 0
- make it so spamming the powerup unlock store element is nicer
- add the mute dialogue option
- make the color window (rework it code and graphic)
