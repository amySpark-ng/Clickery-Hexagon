# ISSUES (hell)
## Current TODO (small stuff mostly)

<!-- ================ -->
	IMPORTANT!!!!!!
<!-- ================ -->
- start work on newgrounds api and leaderboards -->

<!-- balancing -->
- increase the prices of click upgrades and cursor upgrades
^ just a little
- make cursors more powerful so you don't have to click too much
- make the start ascending at 50 millions
- everything is too easy to get but at the same time it's too hard
- you shouldn't be able to buy awesome powerup
- make cursors almost as powerful as clicks but make them more expensive

<!-- ascension -->
- takes 10-15-20 mins to reach 75 million of total score, that's good
- maybe 40 millions is good too, game gets boring a little bit after 30
- there's a point where stuff is too expensive and you have to click too much to buy at least
^ that's where you got to ascend
- balance powerups they are TOOOO FUCKING OP TOOK ME 5 MINUTES REACH 70 MILLIONS

<!-- graphics -->
- change color of upgrades
- you can see hexagon in ascend substate even if scale is 0
- make it so spamming the powerup unlock store element is nicer
- add the mute dialogue option
- make the color window (rework it code and graphic)
	^ make both windows different files and make a different file for buttons and sliders

- blinking text is on the wrong position
- upgrade tutorial tooltip doesn't work
- stacked upgrades text doesn't work for cursors
