# TODAY
- Remove the dumb "drop drags on mouse out" and just make it always like that
	* Have to unify all mouse release functions and call them drop() or something like that  
- Keep working on store
	* I have to tell devky to make the upgrade icons and the upgrade store element, then i can work on it 
- Figure out why gamescene breaks when re-entering after being on ascendscnee
	^ It's probably because variables that are outside of the scene are not getting resetted 
	^ shadows work weird
	* MAYBE ascendscene will be a substate instead of an actual scene
- Format actual working numbers
	* Make it work with new shorten numbers setting (might not do)
- Re-design/make working toasts
	* Add support for icons
	^ Manage to do text wrappings
- Start start animation
- Rework tooltips
- Fix panderito hitbox

# Soon

- and click priortiy

# Issues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
## General
- REWRITING THE MOUSE SYSTEM IN PROGRESS:
	* Unactive windows have some undesired behaviour (not unhovering hexagon)
	* Buttons inside windows don't have hovers
	* Minibuttons will play "cursor" sometims when hovering from the folderObj
- Make pinch animation
- music doesn't loop on gamescene
cursor gets something when combo is high
- volume works weirdly when muted (like if you mute it and lower it and increase it)

## Windows
- You can click hexagon while hovering window for drag, then you drag it and it will not play clickRelease
* For clicking behind object should check if any other window that is not the current one is active, if any other window is active the button should not work

### Store
* Store elements don't go darker with the unactive color because their color is being defined by score amount and price
### Music
* Change vynil to cd, looks better
- fix music waving speed
### Color
* Sliders are not precise, too lazy to fix it probably

# Ideas
- Add achievement for making the hexagon black and the bg white (bad apple)
- Do the funny thing with music title in clicker.wav like deltarune did
- Random chance of cursor making something funny (going upwards that'd be funny)
- Add an achievement for opening all windows in your taskbar at the same time
- Make unactive windows grayscale
- Discount powerup (very short)
