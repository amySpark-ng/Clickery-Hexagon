# Issues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
## General

## Windows
* For clicking behind object should check if any other window that is not the current one is active, if any other window is active the button should not work

# Ideas
- Add achievement for making the hexagon black and the bg white (bad apple)
- Do the funny thing with music title in clicker.wav like deltarune did
- Add an achievement for opening all windows in your taskbar at the same time
- Make unactive windows grayscale
- Discount powerup (very short)
- when clicking run through every achievement in an object that has a clicking property and check if the score is higher or equal to a value property, so:
```js
	onClick(() => {
		achivements.forEach((achievement) => {
			if (!achievement.clicking) return;
			if (GameState.score >= achievement.value && !gamestate.unlockedAchievements.100score) unlockAchievement(achivements.100score)
		})
	})
```
- ADD THE THING WHERE THE GNOME WALKS ACROSS THE SCREEN AND BE LIKE HOLY SHIT GUYS DID YOU SEE THAT?
	* Every second have a chance of something% that triggers it
