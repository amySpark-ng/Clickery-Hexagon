Doing this so i can finally delete the old winStore file because it's kinda pissing me off

- Add is hovering upgrade
- checkPrice
- hoverStarts and hoverFinishes
- if is dragging window shouldn't be able to do anything

- readd getframe function depending on the workings of the new upgrade animation system
- not do buyUpgrade function, yucks, add them to the object
